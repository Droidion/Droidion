I am a fullstack web developer.

Mainly Vue/Nuxt and Svelte/Kit.

Going functional for backends.

I work at [Aibidia](https://aibidia.com), helping automate transfer pricing.

Some recent personal projects:
- [Opus Classical](https://opusclassical.net), small service to help navigate the complex world of classical music recordings. I wrote this one 4 times in 4 languages: F#, Rust, Elixir and Go, the latter being currently in production.
- [TIM Group website](https://timseminar.ru), traditional web site written in Go, private Github repo.
